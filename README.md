#### Running the project

Inside the project folder, start by starting the virtual environment and installing the dependencies:

```bash
$ source ./bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then generate a random map with the following command:

```bash
# Feel free to change the number of places on the firsts lines of the script
$ python src/maps_examples/generate_matrix_map.py
```


This will create `random_places.json` and `random_places_routes.json` to be used in the project.

Then, you can run the project with the following command:

```bash
$ python src/main.py
```
